# Repository for "Predicting Healthcare Expenditures for Individuals with Breast Cancer: Considering Chronic Comorbidities within a Two-Stage Machine Learning Approach" Paper
This repository holds files and relevant materials for completing a semester-long research project for the Penn State University course DS 340W (Jason Ficorilli - Group 69 - DS 340W-Section 005).

The "Project Implementation" folder holds files and materials related to my project's final paper: "Predicting Healthcare Expenditures for Individuals with Breast Cancer: Considering Chronic Comorbidities within a Two-Stage Machine Learning Approach." This paper used pooled data from the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) Household Component (HC) Full Year Consolidated (FYC) data files (years 2015, 2017, 2021, and 2023) and a two-stage super learner machine learning model to predict total and total out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures for individuals with breast cancer, exploring the influence of chronic comorbiditiy covariates through evaluating comparative model performance, creating global model SHAP values and visualizations, and sensitivity analysis. The folder's "analysis_file.qmd" file was the primary code file used for this project.

The "Replicating Parent Paper" holds files and materials for my efforts to recreate the MEPS analysis section of the paper "A two-stage super learner for healthcare expenditures" (2022) from Wu et al. [1]. Please use caution when running any of the R files in the folder in a local (non-cloud/cluster) computing environemnt, as they are computationally intensive and are implemented utilizing paralell computation in R.

For any inquiries related to this repository and its files, please contact Jason Ficorilli (email: jsf5479@psu.edu).
